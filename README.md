## Introduction

For most of my projects I need icons. Usually pretty common ones, sometimes unique for what I want to do. That's why I've created my own set of icons so that I have a good base which I can extend without having to worry about inconsistencies.

If you want to add your own icons you can use the `guidelines.svg` as. The default stroke-width is 2px with rounded caps and joins.

### /jw-icons

All icons as svg-shapes.

### /animations

Some of the icons are animated and exported as json-files for [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) (formerly Bodymovin).
